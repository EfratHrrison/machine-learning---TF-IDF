I applied basic text mining methods on information from Simple English Wikipedia.
constructed a simple search engine on the corpus and learn to retrieve articles by short description
created csv files woth the results :  the csv files should contain results for word counts (with and without stop words) and
TF-IDF (with and without stop words).
